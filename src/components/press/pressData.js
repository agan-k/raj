      quote: `Eschewing any type of fireworks in favor of a relaxed, smooth flowing, the set of songs proposed
      by Jayaweera - his rhythmic sensibilities are reminiscent of Paul Motian, Brian Blade and Peter
      Erskine - is fruitful, generous and transparent in its purest form.`,
      body: [`New York-based Sri Lankan/Australian drummer and composer Rajiv Jayaweera presents a
      wonderful set of original compositions on his commendable debut album, Pistils. Establishing a
      deep and intimate musical connection with the virtuosic members of the combo he leads -
      saxophonist Chris Cheek, pianist Aaron Parks, guitarist Hugh Stuckey, and bassist Sam Anning -
      the drummer pays tribute to his Sri Lankan roots, devising nine elegant tunes with unobtrusive
      arrangements that allows the music to flow with charm and beauty.`,

      `Bookending the album are two different versions of “Pistils”, whose title evokes the huge
      variety of flowers in Sri Lanka. On both of them, the group cruises tranquil waters, with the
      difference that the opening tune features the voice of guest vocalist Lara Bello, who sings in
      an improvised language, while the closing version displays the emotionally rich melodies of
      Cheek - on tenor saxophone - floating above the surface.`,

      `“Ellstandisa” is a made up word that resulted from the combination of Jayaweera’s grandparents’
      names. The piece is introduced by temple drum, and then embraces a contemporary 7/8 coolness
      replete with ample harmonic sophistication and enchanting motivic melody delivered in unison.
      The rhythm section provides a fertile terrain for pleasurable improvisations from Cheek and
      Parks, and while the former draws attention as he binds attractive jazz idioms and
      soul-nourishing tones, the latter cooks up a delightful solo that feels, by turns, playful and
      momentous.`,

      `Denoting a gentle polyrhythmic feel and folk intonations, the carefully sculpted “Welikadawatte”
      also showcases an understated bossa groove embedded in the bottom layer. Delivered in six, the
      piece thrives with superior statements by the usual suspects, namely Cheek and Parks.`,

      `If the two pieces I’ve just described - and we can add the sharply percussive “The Elephant”
      to the assemblage - spiral upward into the sky in a balancing act between lyrical folk and fresh
      contemporary jazz, then “Galadari” and “Hirimbura” grounds us a bit more, showing that the group
      is capable of muscling up when the music calls for it.The former number denotes bold shifts in
      tempo and has Cheek and Stuckey trading bars with keenness; the latter piece, on the other hand,
      swings uncompromisingly with hard - bop ardor, stepping into more familiar territory.`,

      `Eschewing any type of fireworks in favor of a relaxed, smooth flowing, the set of songs proposed
      by Jayaweera - his rhythmic sensibilities are reminiscent of Paul Motian, Brian Blade and Peter
      Erskine - is fruitful, generous and transparent in its purest form.`],

      title: `Drummer/Percussionist/Composer Rajiv Jayaweera
      Presents Pistils`,
      subtitle: `This collection of original compositions by New York-based Rajiv Jayaweera is a deeply
      personal reflection of his strong South Asian culture and identity that is dear to his heart`,
      subtitle1: `Featuring Chris Cheek (soprano & tenor saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh
      Stuckey (guitar), Sam Anning (double bass), Rajiv Jayaweera (drums, cymbals, thammattama,
      caxixi), Lara Bello (voice)`,
      body: [`Pistils is the debut recording from Sri Lankan/Australian jazz drummer and composer,
      Rajiv Jayaweera. The album showcases eight compelling, thoughtful originals, which draw
      inspiration from Sri Lanka.  Jayaweera’s compositions feature strong melodies and beauty,
      coupled with intricate bass lines and rhythmic interplay.  His band of Chris Cheek (soprano &
      tenor saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh Stuckey (guitar) and Sam Anning (double bass),
      truly display why they are amongst the most revered and sought-after musicians on the scene
      today.`,

      `The album is bookended by two different versions of the title track, Pistils. The
      first is sparse and free of time, with the profoundly emotive vocals of special guest, Lara
      Bello. It closes with a stripped back trio take with guitar, saxophone and drums playing the
      “Pistils” theme, with the style of the great Paul Motian trio in mind. The melody of Pistils
      is a monumental achievement, and the centerpiece of this wonderful debut from an artist
      overflowing with potential and possibilities. One of the most special characteristics in Sri
      Lanka is the variety of flowers that exist there. In trying to get to the essence of these
      flowers, you find the seed-bearing organs, collectively known as “pistils.” Jayaweera was drawn
      to the word pistils because it took him to the heart of these flowers.`,

      `"Ellstandissa", featuring the relatively unknown Thammattama drum (also known as a temple drum),
      a two-headed traditional drum played with a pair of fascinating curly wooden sticks and most
      commonly used in cultural ceremonies, incorporates rhythms from a Sri Lankan dance entitled
      Gajaga Wannama, or dance of the elephant, in 7/8 time. The main melody of the song is circular
      and haunting, and is played over a counter melody that superimposes a polyrhythmic figure.
      Ellstandissa is a made up word combining the names of the composer’s grandparents.`,

      `It’s fitting that the next track is "Welikadawatte", translating to Welikada Gardens in Sinhalese.
      It is an area in central Colombo (the commercial capital and largest city in Sri Lanka),
      originally home to many large cinnamon and coconut plantations. For over forty years this was
      where Rajiv’s grandparents lived and a place he would visit each year. Musically, this piece is
      reminiscent of Ahmad Jamal’s famous tune, Poinciana. The "Elephant", once again incorporating the 
      Thammattama drum, conjures up the image of anelephant walking through the jungle.`,

      `Hirimbura is Rajiv’s Grandfather’s hometown in the south of Sri Lanka. The piece has ‘stompy’
      Charles Mingus-esque feel that is simultaneously modern and traditional in nature. The strong
      quarter-note pulse instinctively makes you want to tap your foot or click your fingers along to
      it. A "Malkoha Bird" is a tropical bird endemic to Sri Lanka with a long graduated tail. This is the
      only song on the album where saxophonist Chris Cheek switches from tenor to soprano, singing the
      melody like a bird.`],

      subtitle: `Trio Kleine Ahnung (Carl Morgan, Rajiv Jayaweera, Sam Anning) release their debut album,
      Laniakea `,
      subtitle1: `Laniakea is the new album from Trio Kleine Ahnung, a collaboration between guitarist
      Carl Morgan, bassist Sam Anning and drummer Raj Jayaweera. Spawned from a week off from a busy
      European tour schedule, the members contribute stand-out compositions and performances that draw
      inspiration from indie- rock, Radiohead and German folk-song, creating an impressive album that
      stands on the shoulders of guitar greats such as Bill Frisell and Kurt Rosenwinkel. `,
      body: [`Having performed in a variety of settings over the past ten years, the individuals have
      long wanted to collaborate in a deeper way. All raised in Australia, the members currently live
      in different parts of the world – Morgan in Berlin, Jayaweera in New York and Anning in
      Melbourne. It was only until an act of serendipity in 2019 brought them together in Berlin
      together. The trio spent a week in Morgan’s studio jamming, in between sessions of eating,
      drinking, and debating at the local Imren Grill. The music captures their informal spirit and
      yet enshrines the seriousness and dedication to their art. `,
      `From the tough and intrepid ‘Intro’, ‘Datameta’ slowly divulges into an epic anthem.
      ‘Kleine Ahnung’ hints at 60’s Miles with the contemporary twist of special guest synthesizer
      soloist, Sean Wayland. ‘Laniakea’ is a harmonically intelligent song-like tune that hints at a
      multitude of influences yet stands alone. ‘Ripples’ invokes a Seattle grunge soundscape against
      a backdrop of future alien terra firma. ‘Gott Liebt Diese Welt’ is a clever reharmonisation of
      the hymn by Walter Schulz that tips its hat to Radiohead. ‘Losdy’ is a chorale inspired piece
      with a spiral-like feeling as each repeat moves onto an altered trajectory. ‘Outro’ gives the
      sense of more to come with its high energy brevity leaving us wanting more. `,
      `Carl Morgan is a guitarist-composer from Sydney, currently based in Berlin. Winner of
      the 2014 National Jazz Awards for guitar, Carl has performed with a wide variety of musicians
      including Maria Schneider, Chris Potter, Jim McNeely, Bob Mintzer, Charlie Watts, Barney McAll,
      Mike Nock, Kristin Berardi, and the Jazzgroove Mothership Orchestra.`,
      `Rajiv Jayaweera is a highly sought-after drummer, having toured and recorded with some of
      Australia’s premiere musicians including Joe Chindamo, The Bennett’s Lane Big Band, Bopstretch
      and The Australian Art Orchestra. Since moving to New York, he has performed at many of the
      city’s jazz clubs including Jazz at Lincoln Centre, Doha, The Cotton Club, as well as around
      the world including Tokyo, The London Jazz Festival and throughout Europe. He currently leads
      his own quintet and will release his debut album Pistils this year.`,
      `Sam Anning is a major force in Australian jazz, being a prolific recording artist and
      performer and first-call bassist for many of the country’s premiere jazz ensembles. He studied
      and lived in New York City for a number of years before returning to Melbourne. His recent
      release, Across a Field As Vast As One, was short-listed for the Australian Music Prize and won
      both The Age Music Victoria Awards for Jazz and a Jazz Bell Award. `],

      from the pack with "Pistils".`,
      body: [`While London-born, Melbourne-reared, New York-based drummer Rajiv Jayaweera's work is naturally 
      colored by his experiences spanning those points on the map, it's his Sri Lankan heritage that most
      greatly informs and influences this debut. Drawing inspiration from memories of nature, sounds and scents
      surrounding his grandparents' garden there, Jayaweera creates a musical sanctuary and wonderland painted
      in vivid colors.`,
         `Pistils, a title referencing the seed-bearing, reproductive portion of a flower, plays on blooming 
      beauty at its first glances and in its final form. Opening and closing with different versions of the
      title track—the former featuring guest vocalist Lara Bello's enchantments, the latter saxophonist Chris
      Cheek's mellifluous lines—Jayaweera uses rubato fantasies to bookend his vision. The tracks between the
      "Pistils" prove just as meaningful and fascinating in their unfolding of grace. "Ellstandissa," starting
      on a solo performance of the Thammattama drum(s) and working with a more direct rhythmic thrust, deals
      with cycling melodic ideals and dancing time. "Welikadawatte," nodding to a region in Colombo, Sri Lanka,
      where Jayaweera's grandparents lived for four decades, rides on a Vernel Fournier-esque groove and a
      sweeping current. "Galadari," a gorgeously dizzying latticework, proves to be a showcase for serious solo
      work. And "Nilus," with its slow, stately stride, speaks in measured yet decorative language.`,
         `Jayaweera's creative gifts with pen and sticks are apparent over the course of the first half of the 
      album, but so, too, are his gifts in personnel selection. With Cheek, pianist Aaron Parks, guitarist
      Hugh Stuckey and bassist Sam Anning filling out the ranks, the drummer is never short on unique and
      pliant personalities. The remaining material simply furthers that fact. There's "The Elephant," evoking
      images of a pachyderm making its way across the jungle; "Hirimbura," a swinging geographical beacon
      pointing to Jayaweera's grandfather's hometown; and "Malkoha Bird," which finds Cheek moving to soprano
      to best reflect the song and shining spirit of one of Sri Lanka's feathered friends.`,
         `While drummer-composers often feel a need to make their mark through a show of force, Jayaweera takes 
      a more fanciful approach. Preferring blossoming expressions over bombast, he separates himself from the

      body: [`"Pistils" is the debut album by Sri Lankan/Australian jazz drummer and composer, Rajiv Jayaweera.
      The album features eight original compositions by the New York-based Jayaweera that draw inspiration
      from Sri Lanka. Jayaweera, who plays drums, cymbals, thammattama, and caxixi, leads a band of Chris
      Cheek (soprano & tenor saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh Stuckey (guitar), and Sam Anning
      (double bass). Lara Bello adds her voice as a special guest.`,
         `Two versions of the title track open and close this recording. The initial rendition of "Pistils" 
      features Lara Bello's enchanting vocal set against a sparse setting. This composition illustrates
      Jayaweera's ability to compose beautiful melodies. "Ellstandissa," opens with the leader playing the
      relatively unknown Thammattama drum (also known as a temple drum), a two-headed traditional drum that
      is played with a pair of fascinating curly wooden sticks. It incorporates rhythms from a Sri Lankan
      dance entitled 'Gajaga Wannama' in 7/8 time. Again, we are given a memorable melody, which provides
      Cheek an opportunity to display his marvelous tone as well as the ensemble's intricate rhythmic
      interplay. Parks adds a choice piano solo here as well.`,
      `The next song, "Welikadawatte," translates to Welikada Gardens in Sinhalese. This title refers to an 
      area in central Colombo (the commercial capital and largest city in Sri Lanka). Against the stately
      rhythm, it affords another opportunity for Cheek to display the warmth of his saxophone. At the same
      time, Stuckey accents with his chords, and the leader's deft drumming lightly pushes the performance
      along. Anning's bass hints at Ahmad Jamal's classic performance of "Poinciana." Cheek's tenor sax is
      at the fore of "Galadari" with an intriguing rhythm and bass riff along with some stop-time passages.
      Stuckey contributes a scintillating solo. The ballad "Nilus" is a scrumptious performance with Cheek
      playing with a sublime tone, while bassist Anning also solos strongly.`,
         `Jayaweera incorporates the Thammattama drum on the playful "The Elephant," with Parks playing in a 
      bouncy fashion. There is a bluesy feel to "Hirimbura," which takes its title from Rajiv's Grandfather's
      hometown in the south of Sri Lanka, with Cheek's robust tenor at the forefront, with Parks adding a
      well-constructed solo as well. Cheek switches to soprano sax for "A Malkoha Bird," playing an
      appropriately flighty solo.`,
      `An instrumental version of the title track closes this recording with Cheek's sax set against Stuckey's 
      lush chords. Jayaweera adds his rhythmic accents with a deft touch on the cymbals and the snare drum in
      an evocative performance. It caps an excellent recording of first-rate performances of memorable and

      `'Pistils' is his debut. Jayaweera lets the New York influences sink in but doesn't forget his Sri 
      Lankan roots. He incorporates this colorful mixture into the eight compositions he wrote for this
      album. He brought in Chris Cheek, Aaron Parks, Hugh Stuckey, Sam Anning and Lara Bello to work
      everything out expertly. Fortunately, it was not a meaningless fusion or crossover. All the classic
      basic elements from western jazz are ingeniously woven into the songs. The Asian influences remain
      extremely limited but are always very functional, such as the use of the thammattama drum or temple
      drum in 'Ellstandissa' and 'The Elephant'.`,
      `The emphasis is now on a lyrical approach with a strong focus on smooth melody lines, then on an 
      adapted rhythm pattern to obtain a (feather) light trance effect. This balancing act keeps the whole
      thing interesting and engaging. Most different is 'Hirimbura', a semi-blues shuffle. To give an
      interesting insight into the whole potential, the CD starts and ends with the title track, albeit each
      time with a different soloist. At the beginning it is vocalist Lara Bello and at the end Chris Cheek
      gets to do his thing.`,

      to Sri Lankan parents, Jayaweera grew up in Melbourne, where he completed his Bachelor of Music at 
      the Victorian College of the Arts before finishing his Masters in Jazz studies in New York in 2013. In
      the liner notes of his debut album Pistils, Jayaweera explains that the album is dedicated to his 
      grandparents and the music on it draws inspiration from his Sri Lankan roots and culture. The vastness
      of Sri Lanka's flora is among the country's main characteristics and the reason why flowers grace the 
      cover of the record and why pistils, a flower's seed-bearing organ, is the album's name and

      his instrument is a rare thing in the drummer landscape and his sense for melody in composition all 
      the more exceptional.`,
      `Jayaweera is joined by a number of household names. Chris Cheek on tenor and soprano and Aaron Parks, 
      who belongs among today's most sought after sidemen on piano, join the Sri Lankan drummer with the 
      addition of Hugh Stuckey's guitar highlighting the melodies and Sam Anning, who appears with Jayaweera
      on Carl Morgan's recent trio outing Laniakea (Earshift Records, 2020), adding the deep frequency 
      grooves. Vocalist Lara Bello introduces the album as a guest on the title track, of which a different 
      version reappears as a closer. The first vocal version of the track is a sparsely instrumented affair
      performed in rubato to dashing cymbals and playful melodic ornamentation accompanying Bello's fragile 
      wordless musings. Rhythm arrives subtly but determinedly on "Ellstandissa," which builds on a downward 
      moving phrase shared in unison between guitar and sax. The drums decide that the tune be counted in 
      three after a couple of ambiguous minutes, but playfully reinvent themselves throughout the track, in
      accord with Parks' acrobatic harmonic sidesteps and lush chord spreads.`, `Swing, melodic motifs and 
      solo excursions happen entirely naturally throughout a debut effort which breathes unexpectedly cool. 
      Jayaweera doesn't feel the need to prove anything but tenderly accompany his sidemen, who's nimble 
      contributions pour out of them with remarkable fluency. Still a rhythmical pulse often works as the 
      driving force behind the band. "Welikadawette"'s laid-back dance six-time is a workout in cool jazz 
      bound to a refined head, again introduced in unison by frets and keys, while "Galadari"'s uneven drive 
      in eleven-time is skillfully subdivided in constantly alternating phrases of five and six. Other cuts
      follow suit.`, 
      `Before long, "Pistils" returns to close the record on a quiet note, again performed in large rubato 
      strides. This time around piano, bass and vocals aren't part of the equation, yet the elasticity shared 
      between the trio of drums, guitar and sax is of similarly colorful breadth, ending this formidably 
      tempered album on a humble, yet modestly virtuoso note. Jayaweera is not only a drummer to be reckoned 
      with, but also an ace composer whose understated attitude and chops may deserve mentioning in the same
      breath with groove heavy-weights like Brian Blade before long.`],

      body: [`Until now, the musician of Sri Lankan origin has only appeared in our reviews once, and then as 
      a sideman. So, composer, band leader and drummer Rajiv Jayavira is the first Lankan to be featured on the
      site with an author's work. True, Rajiv has only Sri Lankan roots, but he was born in London, grew up in
      Melbourne and received his first musical education in Australia. By the way, the album Pistlis, the
      debut for Rajiv, was created with the assistance of the Australian Council for the Arts. But Jayavira
      has lived and worked for the last ten years in New York and is in great demand in the jazz capital of
      the world: he played here with many famous musicians and performed on the stages of the most prestigious
      clubs. Rajiv also played at many major jazz festivals in different countries - in Tokyo, London,
      Montreux, Copenhagen.`,
      `Rajiv Jayaweera recorded his debut album in April 2019 in New York. The program of nine tracks is 
      entirely his own music. Experienced New York musicians took part in the recording of the album with
      him, and on two tracks the vocals are performed by the Spaniard Lara Bello. The already bright "tropical"
      cover suggests that the main theme of Jayavira's work was the memories of the ancestral homeland -
      Beautiful Lanka: this is how the name Sri Lanka sounds in translation. One might assume that ethnicity
      predominates in music as well. However, with the exception of the fact that Rajiv himself used several
      ethnic percussion instruments when recording, including the Sri Lankan thammattama or temple drum, and
      the names of most of the compositions, you do not feel a significant influence of ethnic motives in the
      music itself. The ensemble under the direction of Rajiv Jayavira plays music close to the modern
      mainstream, with a solo saxophone (Chris Chick), piano, guitar and rhythm group. At the same time,
      the leader of the band does not overuse some solo improvisations. Jayavira is more busy thinking about
      the coherence of the ensemble sound and the accurate transfer of his composing ideas. The program of the
      album is built in the form of a kind of rondo, beginning and ending with the piece Pistils, only in the
      opening version Lara Bello sings, and in the purely instrumental finish track Chris Chick comes to the
      fore. For me, a kind of peak of the album fell in the middle: I especially note such compositions as
      Nilus and The Elephant. However, there is plenty to choose from: the album shows that in the person of
      Rajiv Jayavira we are meeting a very interesting and creative master.`],

      body: [`“ Pistils ” is the debut recording by Sri Lankan and Australian jazz drummer and composer 
      Rajiv Jayaweera . The album features eight compelling and thoughtful originals, which draw inspiration
      from Sri Lanka. Rajiv Jayaweera's compositions are characterized by strong melodies and beauty, combined
      with complex bass lines and rhythmic playing. His band, made up of Chris Cheek (soprano and tenor
      saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh Stuckey (guitar) and Sam Anning (double bass), really show why
      he is among the most in-demand musicians on today's scene. `,
      `Ellstandissa , which features the relatively little-known Thammattama drum (also called temple drum), 
      a traditional two-headed drum played with a pair of fascinating curly wooden drumsticks and most often
      used in cultural ceremonies, incorporates the rhythms of a Sri Lankan dance called Gajaga Wannama, or
      elephant dance, in 7/8. The main melody of the song is circular and haunting, and is played over a
      counter melody that superimposes a polyrhythmic figure. Ellstandissa is an invented word that combines
      the names of the composer's grandparents.`,
      `Rajiv Jayaweera is truly a citizen of the world, a fact that permeates and weaves its way into his 
      playing and composition. He was born in London, raised in Melbourne, is of Sri Lankan descent and is
      currently based in New York. He received his bachelor's degree in music from Victorian College of the
      Arts in 2000, and a master's degree in jazz studies from SUNY Purchase, New York, in 2013.`,
      `In Australia he has been a very active drummer, touring and recording with the country's top musicians 
      including the Joe Chindamo Trio, Bennett's Lane Big Band, Sam Anning Quintet, Bopstretch, and the
      Crossing Roper Bar Project of the Australian Art Orchestra.`,
      `Since arriving in New York City, Rajiv Jayaweera has performed at legendary jazz clubs, Smalls, The 
      Blue Note, Bar Next Door, Dizzy's (J @ LC), Birdland, and more. He received scholarships from the
      Australian Arts Council, the Ian Potter Cultural Trust and the US-Australian Foundation, and was a
      finalist for the prestigious scholarship Freedman Jazz Fellowship, occurring at the Sydney Opera House
      in 2013.`],
