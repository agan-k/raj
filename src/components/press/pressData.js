      body: [`The Australian This is such a lovely album that it's difficult to know where to start.
      Drummer - percussionist Rajiv Jayaweera now lives in New York, where this album Pistils was recorded.
      Born in London of Sri Lankan parents, he grew up in Melbourne and graduated from the Victorian
      College of the Arts in 2000.`,

      `His nine compositions on Pistils explore an array of contemporary
      time-feels and feature two Americans, Chris Cheek (saxophones) and Aaron Parks (piano), plus two
      Australians in Hugh Stuckey (guitar) and Sam Anning (double bass). Spaniard Lara Bello sings on the
      title track. The basic character of the music is determined by Jayaweera, a drummer of unusual
      subtlety and good taste, always alive to punctuating the music but never intrusive. Anning's bass
      lines, beautifully recorded, can be felt as well as heard. It's such a pleasure to know there
      are modern jazz musicians in the world playing like this.`,

      album: 'Pistils',
      label: 'Outside in Music, 2020',
      quote: `"Eschewing any type of fireworks in favor of a relaxed, smooth flowing, the set of songs proposed
      by Jayaweera - his rhythmic sensibilities are reminiscent of Paul Motian, Brian Blade and Peter
      Erskine - is fruitful, generous and transparent in its purest form."`,
      body: [`New York-based Sri Lankan/Australian drummer and composer Rajiv Jayaweera presents a
      wonderful set of original compositions on his commendable debut album, Pistils. Establishing a
      deep and intimate musical connection with the virtuosic members of the combo he leads -
      saxophonist Chris Cheek, pianist Aaron Parks, guitarist Hugh Stuckey, and bassist Sam Anning -
      the drummer pays tribute to his Sri Lankan roots, devising nine elegant tunes with unobtrusive
      arrangements that allows the music to flow with charm and beauty.`,

      `Bookending the album are two different versions of “Pistils”, whose title evokes the huge
      variety of flowers in Sri Lanka. On both of them, the group cruises tranquil waters, with the
      difference that the opening tune features the voice of guest vocalist Lara Bello, who sings in
      an improvised language, while the closing version displays the emotionally rich melodies of
      Cheek - on tenor saxophone - floating above the surface.`,

      `“Ellstandisa” is a made up word that resulted from the combination of Jayaweera’s grandparents’
      names. The piece is introduced by temple drum, and then embraces a contemporary 7/8 coolness
      replete with ample harmonic sophistication and enchanting motivic melody delivered in unison.
      The rhythm section provides a fertile terrain for pleasurable improvisations from Cheek and
      Parks, and while the former draws attention as he binds attractive jazz idioms and
      soul-nourishing tones, the latter cooks up a delightful solo that feels, by turns, playful and
      momentous.`,

      `Denoting a gentle polyrhythmic feel and folk intonations, the carefully sculpted “Welikadawatte”
      also showcases an understated bossa groove embedded in the bottom layer. Delivered in six, the
      piece thrives with superior statements by the usual suspects, namely Cheek and Parks.`,

      `If the two pieces I’ve just described - and we can add the sharply percussive “The Elephant”
      to the assemblage - spiral upward into the sky in a balancing act between lyrical folk and fresh
      contemporary jazz, then “Galadari” and “Hirimbura” grounds us a bit more, showing that the group
      is capable of muscling up when the music calls for it.The former number denotes bold shifts in
      tempo and has Cheek and Stuckey trading bars with keenness; the latter piece, on the other hand,
      swings uncompromisingly with hard - bop ardor, stepping into more familiar territory.`,

      `Eschewing any type of fireworks in favor of a relaxed, smooth flowing, the set of songs proposed
      by Jayaweera - his rhythmic sensibilities are reminiscent of Paul Motian, Brian Blade and Peter
      Erskine - is fruitful, generous and transparent in its purest form.`],

      album: 'Pistils',
      label: 'Available June 5, 2020 on Outside in Music / Earshift Music (Australia/Asia)',
      title: `Drummer/Percussionist/Composer Rajiv Jayaweera
      Presents Pistils`,
      subtitle: `This collection of original compositions by New York-based Rajiv Jayaweera is a deeply
      personal reflection of his strong South Asian culture and identity that is dear to his heart`,
      subtitle1: `Featuring Chris Cheek (soprano & tenor saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh
      Stuckey (guitar), Sam Anning (double bass), Rajiv Jayaweera (drums, cymbals, thammattama,
      caxixi), Lara Bello (voice)`,
      body: [`Pistils is the debut recording from Sri Lankan/Australian jazz drummer and composer,
      Rajiv Jayaweera. The album showcases eight compelling, thoughtful originals, which draw
      inspiration from Sri Lanka.  Jayaweera’s compositions feature strong melodies and beauty,
      coupled with intricate bass lines and rhythmic interplay.  His band of Chris Cheek (soprano &
      tenor saxophones), Aaron Parks (piano), Hugh Stuckey (guitar) and Sam Anning (double bass),
      truly display why they are amongst the most revered and sought-after musicians on the scene
      today.`,

      `The album is bookended by two different versions of the title track, Pistils. The
      first is sparse and free of time, with the profoundly emotive vocals of special guest, Lara
      Bello. It closes with a stripped back trio take with guitar, saxophone and drums playing the
      “Pistils” theme, with the style of the great Paul Motian trio in mind. The melody of Pistils
      is a monumental achievement, and the centerpiece of this wonderful debut from an artist
      overflowing with potential and possibilities. One of the most special characteristics in Sri
      Lanka is the variety of flowers that exist there. In trying to get to the essence of these
      flowers, you find the seed-bearing organs, collectively known as “pistils.” Jayaweera was drawn
      to the word pistils because it took him to the heart of these flowers.`,

      `"Ellstandissa", featuring the relatively unknown Thammattama drum (also known as a temple drum),
      a two-headed traditional drum played with a pair of fascinating curly wooden sticks and most
      commonly used in cultural ceremonies, incorporates rhythms from a Sri Lankan dance entitled
      Gajaga Wannama, or dance of the elephant, in 7/8 time. The main melody of the song is circular
      and haunting, and is played over a counter melody that superimposes a polyrhythmic figure.
      Ellstandissa is a made up word combining the names of the composer’s grandparents.`,

      `It’s fitting that the next track is "Welikadawatte", translating to Welikada Gardens in Sinhalese.
      It is an area in central Colombo (the commercial capital and largest city in Sri Lanka),
      originally home to many large cinnamon and coconut plantations. For over forty years this was
      where Rajiv’s grandparents lived and a place he would visit each year. Musically, this piece is
      reminiscent of Ahmad Jamal’s famous tune, Poinciana. The "Elephant", once again incorporating the Thammattama drum, conjures up the image of an
      elephant walking through the jungle.`,

      `Hirimbura is Rajiv’s Grandfather’s hometown in the south of Sri Lanka. The piece has ‘stompy’
      Charles Mingus-esque feel that is simultaneously modern and traditional in nature. The strong
      quarter-note pulse instinctively makes you want to tap your foot or click your fingers along to
      it. A "Malkoha Bird" is a tropical bird endemic to Sri Lanka with a long graduated tail. This is the
      only song on the album where saxophonist Chris Cheek switches from tenor to soprano, singing the
      melody like a bird.`],

      label: 'Available June 5, 2020 on Outside in Music / Earshift Music (Australia/Asia)',
      title: `### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ###`,
      subtitle: `Trio Kleine Ahnung (Carl Morgan, Rajiv Jayaweera, Sam Anning) release their debut album,
      Laniakea `,
      subtitle1: `Laniakea is the new album from Trio Kleine Ahnung, a collaboration between guitarist
      Carl Morgan, bassist Sam Anning and drummer Raj Jayaweera. Spawned from a week off from a busy
      European tour schedule, the members contribute stand-out compositions and performances that draw
      inspiration from indie- rock, Radiohead and German folk-song, creating an impressive album that
      stands on the shoulders of guitar greats such as Bill Frisell and Kurt Rosenwinkel. `,
      body: [`Having performed in a variety of settings over the past ten years, the individuals have
      long wanted to collaborate in a deeper way. All raised in Australia, the members currently live
      in different parts of the world – Morgan in Berlin, Jayaweera in New York and Anning in
      Melbourne. It was only until an act of serendipity in 2019 brought them together in Berlin
      together. The trio spent a week in Morgan’s studio jamming, in between sessions of eating,
      drinking, and debating at the local Imren Grill. The music captures their informal spirit and
      yet enshrines the seriousness and dedication to their art. `,
      `From the tough and intrepid ‘Intro’, ‘Datameta’ slowly divulges into an epic anthem.
      ‘Kleine Ahnung’ hints at 60’s Miles with the contemporary twist of special guest synthesizer
      soloist, Sean Wayland. ‘Laniakea’ is a harmonically intelligent song-like tune that hints at a
      multitude of influences yet stands alone. ‘Ripples’ invokes a Seattle grunge soundscape against
      a backdrop of future alien terra firma. ‘Gott Liebt Diese Welt’ is a clever reharmonisation of
      the hymn by Walter Schulz that tips its hat to Radiohead. ‘Losdy’ is a chorale inspired piece
      with a spiral-like feeling as each repeat moves onto an altered trajectory. ‘Outro’ gives the
      sense of more to come with its high energy brevity leaving us wanting more. `,
      `Carl Morgan is a guitarist-composer from Sydney, currently based in Berlin. Winner of
      the 2014 National Jazz Awards for guitar, Carl has performed with a wide variety of musicians
      including Maria Schneider, Chris Potter, Jim McNeely, Bob Mintzer, Charlie Watts, Barney McAll,
      Mike Nock, Kristin Berardi, and the Jazzgroove Mothership Orchestra.`,
      `Rajiv Jayaweera is a highly sought-after drummer, having toured and recorded with some of
      Australia’s premiere musicians including Joe Chindamo, The Bennett’s Lane Big Band, Bopstretch
      and The Australian Art Orchestra. Since moving to New York, he has performed at many of the
      city’s jazz clubs including Jazz at Lincoln Centre, Doha, The Cotton Club, as well as around
      the world including Tokyo, The London Jazz Festival and throughout Europe. He currently leads
      his own quintet and will release his debut album Pistils this year.`,
      `Sam Anning is a major force in Australian jazz, being a prolific recording artist and
      performer and first-call bassist for many of the country’s premiere jazz ensembles. He studied
      and lived in New York City for a number of years before returning to Melbourne. His recent
      release, Across a Field As Vast As One, was short-listed for the Australian Music Prize and won
      both The Age Music Victoria Awards for Jazz and a Jazz Bell Award. `],
